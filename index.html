      <h2>Good Night Moon - Book Review</h2>

      <p>Good Night Moon by Margaret Wise Brown</p>
      <p>Every night before bed my dad used to tell me this book by memory, adding some lines so it would include my sister and I. A day without this story would make the night incomplete. 
      The book discribes a house at night and it says goodnight to different objects. The illustrations are very detailed and the contrast of colors makes the book comforting to look at. It is very simple but has a sentimental place in my heart. </p>

      <h2>The BFG - Movie Review</h2>
      <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0Bey4YUGI"> <img src = "https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSah2Ji5mWv2QJhAbmGqnJ_7n92jDOZN01Nv37guYFvO7upgLsz" alt="Image" width='90px'> </a>
      <p>The BFG is a very enjoyable movie. The movie displays the theme of kindness and the dangers of assumptions. Sophie, the protagonist, accidentally catches sight of the BFG in the night and gets captured from her orphanage in London. She assumes that the giant who captured her is going to kill and eat her but to her surprise, he is actually really nice and just wants to protect both of them. As the characters grow to know eachother, their friendship grows and they are able to complete feets and overcome their fears.
